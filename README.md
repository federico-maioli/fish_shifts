# fish_shifts

Full analysis and code for our study on fish redistribution under climate change. For the manuscript please see <link to bioarkiv/paper>.

The analysis is split into the following 5 sections. Sections 2-5 are associated with a specific directory and their own `README.md` file, so see those for more details:

1. **Exploring** raw data for survey data, fish abundance and distribution.
2. **Fit species distribution models** to selected species.
3. **Calculating derived quantities** such as center of gravity, thermal niche and depth niche.
4. `meta_regression/` to explore comparative patterns in redistribution across fish and regions.
